# docker-etcd-backup

For internal usage.

Firstly I think to use [etcd-backup](https://github.com/fanhattan/etcd-backup), but it is too complicated for
me - I can't get it work with my etcd. May be, because it is using v2 etcd protocol.

Now I found [burry.sh](https://github.com/mhausenblas/burry.sh).
